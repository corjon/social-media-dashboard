## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS Modules

### What I learned

I learned how to use Context in order to pass information to any component in the tree. This was also my first time implementing dark mode.

### Continued development

Figure out an alternate way to add a className. I would like to add dark mode classes without changing the parent div className.
